## File Name: common_data_fields_explorer.py
### Title: Common Data Fields Explorer
### ISO Date: 20250415
### Author: telook
### Purpose:
This script was written for the purposes of finding common data field linkages between multiple sheets within 
a single excel file. The final output is to help identify data linkages to be used in the construction of MongoDB pipelines for
further data analysis.
### Note:
adjust the script as needed for the excel file to be used, the sheet names relevant to
the excel sheet to be used, and export file info. The last function is for exporting data back to the original excel file into a 
new sheet/tab. It can be commented out if there is no desire for the export functionality.
